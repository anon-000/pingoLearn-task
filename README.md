# flutter_task ( Flutter Assignment )


## More Details


## Key Points
- The application uses Provider for managing states and separates business logic from the Presentation layer.
- For Routing I have used go_router package ( although I'm a fan of GetX ), but for now just went with the recommended router package.
- Used SharedPreference for storing user session and managing LoggedIn and LoggedOut states.
- FireBase FireSTore is used for storing data and Firebase Email Authentication is used to authenticate user.
- Firebase remote config also implemented.
- Lazy Loading also implented along with shimmers to make loading screen attractive.
- Error Handling and toast displayed.

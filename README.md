# flutter_task ( Flutter Assignment )

Gateway to Ayna AI

## More Details

This a Flutter Web Application I have developed recently to deal with web sockets & local noSQL DBs like Hive.


- [ Application Link ( deployed on Firebase )](https://ayna-assignment-auro.web.app/)
- [ Backup Link ( Github Pages )](https://auro-dev.github.io/)


## Key Points
- The application uses Provider for managing states and separates business logic from the Presentation layer.
- For Routing I have used go_router package ( although I'm a fan of GetX ), but for now just went with the recommended router package.
- Used SharedPreference for storing user session and managing LoggedIn and LoggedOut states.
